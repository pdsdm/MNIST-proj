Live MNIST â€“ Interactive Visualization of Training and Testing

The Live MNIST project aims to create an interactive and dynamic web-based platform that visually represents the training, validation, and testing process of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the classic MNIST dataset.

Key Features:
	1.	Customizable Model Architecture
Users can configure the CNN architecture by adjusting the number of layers and nodes in each layer. As they modify these parameters, they can see real-time updates on the structure and performance of the model.
	2.	Live Training and Validation Visualization
The training and validation process is displayed dynamically, allowing users to observe how the model improves over time. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and weight updates are visualized to enhance understanding.
	3.	Interactive Handwritten Digit Testing
Users can draw a digit directly on the interface, and the model will classify it in real time, displaying the probability distribution for each digit (0-9). This feature allows users to experiment with different handwriting styles and observe how the model interprets them.
	4.	Web-Based Deployment
The project is designed to be accessible via a web interface, making it easy to interact with without requiring local installations.

By combining machine learning, data visualization, and real-time interactivity, this project provides an engaging way to understand deep learning concepts while allowing hands-on experimentation with CNNs.
